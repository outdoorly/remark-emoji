# [v5.0.0](https://github.com/rhysd/remark-emoji/releases/tag/v5.0.0) - 26 May 2024

- **Breaking change:** Drop support for Node.js v16 or earlier following the [Node.js maintenance cycles](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases). Now this package supports Node.js v18 or later.
- Migrate from JavaScript to TypeScript. Now the type definitions are generated by TypeScript compiler automatically. This is just an internal change and the APIs are preserved the same as in v4.0.1.
- Avoid using legacy packages in example codes in the [readme document](https://github.com/rhysd/remark-emoji#readme).
- The [demo with Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/remark-emoji-example-w6yrmm) was rebuilt from scratch with the latest Remark ecosystem and TypeScript.

# [v4.0.1](https://github.com/rhysd/remark-emoji/releases/tag/v4.0.1) - 29 Oct 2023

- Fix type definitions ([#29](https://github.com/rhysd/remark-emoji/issues/29))
  - This plugin is for transforming mdast (Markdown AST). Now it is explicitly defined as the 2nd type parameter of `unified.Plugin`.
  - `@types/mdast` and `unified` are now runtime dependencies. This ensures that the correct versions of those packages are referred by TypeScript compiler.
